## Features
### Navigation bar
The navigation bar is working fully responsvely and is featured on all webpages, making it easy for the users to to navigate with.
* I chosed a simple design so that the navbar would be easy to see.
* When the user hover over on the nav bar, a line appears underneath to make it easier to see which of them they are clicking on.
* On larger screen the nav bar is always located on the right corner.
* On smaller screens the nav bar goes under the logo. 
* If the user click on the logo in the left corner they arrive to the homepage to make it even easier to navigate.
* When the user clicks on the social network text they come to the bottom of the page for the links.
* When the user clicks on the start now text they come to a form to get a guided meditation.

## The main image
The first thing the eyes lands on are the main image that I use through all of the pages.
* The image represent a beautiful calming sky with information text in it.
* I put animation on it so the image zooms out when the home page opens up. It almost looks like the image it self is taking a breathe.
* On the other pages the main image is a rectangule instead of a circle to make it easier responsive with all of the text in it.

* The circles keeps the theme in the design from the home pages main image.
* They are all in orange to keep the same color theme.
* When hover over they get a orange border around them, for the user to understand which one they are about to click on.
* The circles are featured on all pages to make it easy to navigate.
